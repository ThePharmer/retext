# Specification Quality Checklist: Retext SMS Search

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass validation. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`.

Key observations:
- User input was comprehensive and well-defined, eliminating need for clarifications
- Scope explicitly bounded by "Non-requirements for V1" section in user input
- Three user stories defined: Import (P1), Search (P1), Status View (P2)
- Performance requirements captured: 1GB+ files, 2-second search, 1GB RAM constraint
- Edge cases cover error scenarios and duplicate handling
